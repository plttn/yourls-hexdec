# Hexadecimal Keywords
[![The MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org) `Only tested on 1.7`

## Description

Changes the sequential keywords from base36 to base16. That's it. In other
words, the characters available are 0-9, and a-f, in that order, rolling over
at f.

_Untested with base 62. I would assume that it will simply break completely, let me know if it doesn't._

## Installation

1.  In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `hexdec`.
2.  Drop these files in that directory.
3.  Go to the Plugins administration page ( *eg* `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php`) and activate the plugin.
4.  Have fun!
